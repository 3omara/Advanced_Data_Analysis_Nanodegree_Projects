## PISA 2012

PISA stands for Programme for International Student Assessment which is a study aimed at assessing the scholar performance and educational level in various countries through student questionares and measuring the performance of 15-year-old students on various subjects.


## Summary of Findings

- Number of books present in household correlates positively with the average grade index of students

- Overall, females outperform males in maths and sciences in most of the countries (64 out of 68 countries)

- Age influences grade index. An older classmate has a higher probability of academically performing better than a younger one.

- Wealth influences grade index. Climbing the grade index ladder is easier for the financially priviledged students.

- Grade index correlates positively with the student's use of internet.

- Students' attributes to failure do not significantly affect their educational performance.

- Students' degree of belonging to their schools weakly correlates with their educational performance.
